### What I learned

I recently completed a newbie challenge on FrontendMasters, diving deep into the world of CSS Flexbox. Before this, positioning items in dynamic layouts felt complex. Flexbox, however, transformed my approach, offering a streamlined method to align and distribute elements within a container. Through properties like justify-content, align-items, and flex-direction, I mastered the art of creating responsive and visually appealing designs. This wasn't just about grasping a theoretical concept; it was hands-on learning, giving me the confidence to tackle modern web design challenges with a fresh perspective.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<div class="box-details">
  <img src="images/image-qr-code.png" alt="desktop" class="qr-code">
  <p class="title">
    Improve your front-end skills by building projects

  <p class="pera">

  </p>
</div>
```
```css
.box-details img {
  width: 240px;
  height: 260px;
  object-fit: cover;
  border-radius: 15px;

.box-details .title {

  width: 80%;
  color: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);
  text-align: center;
}

```


### Continued development

Having tackled FrontendMasters' challenge, I delved into CSS Flexbox, streamlining complex layouts with newfound mastery. Using pivotal properties, I now confidently craft responsive designs, a testament to my hands-on growth in modern web design. My continuous development highlights my resilience and adaptabilit
